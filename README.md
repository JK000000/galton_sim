# Galton board simulation

This project was created investigate the statistical properties of motion of balls inside a [Galton board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galton_board) for the purpose of the related problem at the [IPT2024](https://2024.iptnet.info/) competition. <br>

Example simulation video and obtained ball flow plot can be found in examples directory.
